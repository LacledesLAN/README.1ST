# Laclede’s LAN Code of Conduct for Open Source Projects

The Laclede’s LAN team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from the Greater Saint Louis area and beyond. In the interests of fostering a collaborative environment we have a few ground rules for community participants.

* Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
* Be respectful. Disagreement is inevitable, but is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. Don't allow frustration with the work to become frustration directed at people. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* Be careful with your words. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can potentially be offensive to those around you, even if you did not mean them to be. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally.
* Be considerate. It is the responsibility of project maintainers to focus on Laclede’s LAN goals. Decisions may be made that reject your code or feature requests that go against our mission. At any time you may fork the projects in accordance with the applicable project license(s).

When we disagree, we try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Laclede’s LAN is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

Laclede’s LAN officers and project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
