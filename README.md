# Welcome to Laclede's LAN on GitHub!

One of our goals as a non-profit is to be as transparent as possible. We are in the process of open-sourcing our projects and most of our technical workflow. Please feel free to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), contribute, participate in, use, and/or provide feedback on any of our projects!

If you have any questions please [contact us](http://www.lacledeslan.com/contact/).
